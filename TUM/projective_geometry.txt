Projective Geometry (Week 10)

How to save a line? m,n ~> special case for vertical lines
How to intersect lines? How to find a line through points? What about areas, special cases...?
Easy solution: projective geometry

-> Points
-> use three-dimensional vectors to save two-dimensional points (not (0, 0, 0))
draw visualization with plane at z=1, line for equivalent vectors
-> represent the point (a, b) as the the vector (a, b, 1) (homogenization)
-> scalar multiples represent the same point
-> normalization: scale last component to 1
-> going back (de-homogenization): normalize the vector (multiply (a, b, c) by 1/c), ignore last component
-> example (4, 6, 2) ~= (2, 3, 1) ~> (2, 3)
-> not possible if last component is zero!
there are more points in this representation
infinite points, make system easier since more complete (later)

-> Lines
-> represented by three-dimensional vectors, too (not (0, 0, 0))
-> generate a plane by the line and (0, 0, 0), take a normal vector
draw visualization with plane at z=1
-> scalar multiples represent the same line
-> one line is not contained in the plane R^2
infinite line, contains exactly the points that are not in R^2, too
completes the system of lines

Why are we doing this?
-> Point p is on line l iff <p, l> = 0 (scalar product)
p has to be orthogonal to the line's normal vector

-> Line through points p and q: p x q (outer product)
should be orthogonal to both points

-> intersection of two lines l and m: l x m
shoul be orthogonal to both lines

example: intersection of an arbitrary quadrilateral's diagonals
draw image, vertices a, b, c, d
-> diagonals l = a x c, m = b x d
-> p = l x m = (a x c) x (b x d) = a x c x b x d
exchange order of all three outer products (e.g. c x a x b x d, a x c x d x b, or b x d x a x c), but take the whole factor
a x b x c x d and a x d x b x c are something else (draw it)
sign change, only scalar factor

-> infinite points
When do infinite points occur?
-> intersections of parallel lines: infinite points
example: (1, 0, 1) x (2, 0 ,1) = (0, 1, 0)
-> interpretation: direction of the lines
(x, 0, z) are all vertical lines
-> connection of infinite points: line at infinity
example: (1, 0, 0) x (0, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 1)
special cases handle themselves

-> using special cases
-> parallel line m to line l through point p
-> infinite point in direction of l: q = l x (0, 0, 1) (line at infinity)
-> connect p and q: m = p x q = p x l x (0, 0, 1)

-> orthogonal direction to infinite point (a, b, 0) is (b, -a, 0)
-> projection of point p on line l
-> infinite point in direction of l: q = l x (0, 0, 1)
-> infinite point in direction of the perpendicular: r = q^{orthogonal}
-> perpendicular: m = r x p
-> projection: m x l

-> area of a triangle through p, q, r
-> normalize p, q, r
-> matrix M = |p, q, r|
-> area: |det M|
area may be negative, points (counter-)clockwise

-> projective transformations
-> linear maps on homogeneous coordinates: matrices in R^{3x3}
-> scalar multiples correspond to the same matrix
8 dimensions, point has 2 dimensions
-> given by the image of 4 non-collinear points
-> computation: a|->a', b|->b', c|->c', d|->d' => Ma=a', Mb=b', Mc=c', Md=d'
-> solve systems of equations with indeterminates as entries of M
Solves a lot (draw pictures): shifting, mirroring, rotating, scaling,
scaling just some directions, combinations of them
think about the corresponding matrices
everything that maps collinear points to collinear points
