NUMBER THEORY

. former: arithmetic (now: elementary calculations)
. study of integers (im- or explicitly)
. since around 1800 BC
	- Pythagorean triples found in Mesopotamia
. many ideas easy to understand
. many important/famous problems
. one of the oldest mathematical interests
	- classical Greece (500-200 BC): Pythagoras (even started cult), Plato, Euclid, Archimedes
	- China (300-500 CE): Sun Tzu/Sunzi
	- India (following centuries)
	- Fibonacci (late 12th c)
	- early modern age: Fermat (17th), Euler (18th), Gauss (18/19th)
. subdivisions
	- Elementary Tools
	- Analytic Number Theory
		uses tools /methods from real/complex analysis
		e.g. Sieve Theory
		e.g. Prime Number Theorem, Goldbach Conjecture, Riemann Hypothesis
	- Algebraic Number Theory
		uses algebraic objects
		can (and does) intersect with Analytic N.Th.
	- Diophantine Geometry
		polynomial equations with integral solutions
		e.g. x^2+y^2 = 1 defines a curve
		rephrase questions in terms of points on curves
	- Probabilistic Number Theory
	- Arithmetic Combinatorics
	- Computations/Algorithms
		al-Khawarizmi
		
. Sieve Theory
	- techniques to count/estimate size of sifted set of integers
	- approximate sifted set by simpler superset (e.g. primes by k-almost primes)
	- Sieve of Eratosthenes (3rd c BC)
		prime sieve
		iteratively mark composites
			. multiples of primes, starting at 2
			. sequence of multiples with constant difference -> arithmetic progression
				- main advantage over trial division
		efficient for smaller primes
		complexity: exp. in input size (poly-time-algorithms [for primality testing] exist since 2002)
		
. Euclidean Algorithm
	- gcd(a,b)
	- can be extended to polynomials etc.
	- a and b coprime : gcd(a,b) = 1
	- lcm(a,b)
	- Extended Euclidean Algorithm
		ax+by = gcd(a,b)
		useful if coprime:
			x is modular mult. inv. of a mod b (ax = 1 mod b)
			y is modular mult. inv. of b mod a (by = 1 mod a)
			(essential step in the RSA encryption method)
		standard: compute Euclidean divisors
		extended: use quotients!
		standard: q1...q_k, r0...r_{k+1}
			r0 = a, r1 = b
			for r>1: find q_i and r_i s.t.
				r_{i-2} = q_{i-1}*r_{i-1} + r_i until r_{k+1}=0
			=> gcd(a,b) = r_k
		extended: s0...s_{k+1}, t0...t_{k+1} BÃ©zout coefficients
			s0 = 1, s1 = 0
			t0 = 0, t1 = 1
			s_{i+1} = s_{i-1} - q_i*s_i
			t_{i+1} = t_{i-1} - q_i*t_i
			=> 	gcd(a,b) = a*s_k + b*t_k
		EXAMPLE (from last time):
		i		ri	qi	s_i	t_i
		0	-	516	-	1	0
		1	516	138	3	0	1		516 = 3*138 + 102
		2	138	102	1	1	-3		138 = 1*102 +  36
		3	102	36	2	-1	4		102 = 2* 36 +  30
		4	36	30	1	3	-11		 36 = 1* 30 +   6
		5	30	6	5	-4	15		 30 = 5* 6  +   0
		=> gcd(516,138) = 6	= (-4)*516 + 15*138
			
. Chinese Remainder Theorem
	- 3rd-5th c: Sun Tzu
	- completed and proved later
	- determine number x that when divided by given divisors ni leaves given remainders ai
		n1...nk pairwise coprime
		a1...ak
		-> 	exists x: x = ai mod ni
			and all solutions are congruent mod N = n1*...*nk
	- existence/uniqueness
	- example: 	x = 2 mod 3
				x = 3 mod 4
				x = 1 mod 5
	- brute-force
		convert congruences into sets, write elements mod N = 60
			{2,5,8,11,14,...,68,71,74,...}
			{3,7,11,15,...,67,71,75,...}
			{1,6,11,16,...,66,71,76,...}
		intersect
			{11,71,...}
	- algebraic
		x = 2+3t
		x = 3+4s
		x = 1+5u
		-> x = 2+3t=3 mod 4
			=> 3t = 1 mod 4
			=> t = 3(=3^-1) mod 4
			=> t = 3+4s
		-> x = 2+3t = 2+3(3+4s) = 11+12s
			=> 11+12s = 1 mod 5
			=> 2s = 0 mod 5
			=> s = 0+5u
		-> x = 11+12s = 11+12(5u) = 11+60u
		-> {11,71,131,...}
		60 = lcm(3,4,5) = N
	- constructive
		-> use extended Euclid: ri*ni+si*N/ni = 1
			-13*3+2*20 = 1 => e1 = 40
			-11*4+3*15 = 1 => e2 = 45
			5*5+(-2)12 = 1 => e3 = -24
		-> ei := si*N/ni
			=> ei = 1 mod ni (bc ri*ni+ei = 1),
			   ei = 0 mod nj (j!=i)
		-> x = sum ai*ei
			x = 2*40+3*45+1*(-24) = 191
			all other solutions are congruent to 191 mod 60 = 11 mod 60
		different implementations of Euclid will yield different ei's, but the same solution in the end
