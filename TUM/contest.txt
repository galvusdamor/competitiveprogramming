three team members, only one computer, 5 hours, 8-10 problems
coding time is crucial, always use the computer
prepare all algorithms, maybe write pseudo-code to save time implementing it
assign roles in the team, e.g.:
-> one team member for coding, two for designing algorithms
-> topics assigned to an expert
don't debug in front of the computer, print the source code, debug manually, explain the code to a team member
present solutions to each other to see bugs early on
make an overview of the problems, rate difficulty and time consumption, find topics
bring a team manual, most times ~30 pages
submit everything in the last 10 minutes, penalties don't matter if problems can be solved
discuss sample solutions of problems you didn't solve
